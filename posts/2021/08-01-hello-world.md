![Hello, world](/post-images/hello-world.png)

I just built another blog. Given I already have two blogs (pnq and medium), why would I build another blog engine on my own?

Well, it's because I would like to have some fun playing Elixir. My original blog (pnq) was built on top of jekyll and second on Medium.

This time, I would like to do some experiments on Elixir programming. So blog platform is defintely a good target.

I was encouraged by [Dashbit's great post](https://dashbit.co/blog/welcome-to-our-blog-how-it-was-made) of rolling out one's own blog engine with Elixir. I was thinking, man this is cool, and I want to try it myself!

**Now it's a perfect time to practice!**
