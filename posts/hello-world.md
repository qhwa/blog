# Hello, world!

I just built another blog. Given I already have two blogs (pnq and medium), why would I build another blog engine on my own?

Well, it's because I would like to have some fun playing Elixir. My original blog (pnq) was built on top of jekyll and second on Medium.

This time, I would like to do some experiments on Elixir programming. So blog platform is defintely a good target.
